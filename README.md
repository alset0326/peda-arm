PEDA-ARM - Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB

Finally, we merged the original peda and peda-arm. Use `peda-intel.py` to the original peda, and `peda-arm.py` to the
new arm peda.

longld's peda is amazing. But it cannot work on ARM, especially on Android. So I made some change.

Target ARM is still testing. AARCH64 is now under developing.

**Update in 2025-08-28:**

Try to make PEDA-ARM as a purer, lighter and more flexible debugging tools by moving more functions to plugins,
which still be portable and support both python 2/3.
Type "plugin" to see more help.
Currently, plugins support:

- plugin sample: the example plugin
- plugin cyclic: the cyclic string generate
- plugin intelasm: assemble on x86/x64 platform
- plugin armasm: assemble on arm/arm64 platform
- plugin libheap: install [libheap](https://github.com/cloudburst/libheap) via plugin
- plugin heap: install [gef-heap](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/commands/heap/) via plugin (**recommended**)

## Key Features:

* Just support all commands on original PEDA (except the part of shellcode)
* Use `help peda` to show all the peda help

## Updated Features:

* Add source code context (if it has source code)
* Add system call detect
* Support ARM style jump instructions (b*/cbz) detect
* Support full arm/thumb assemble
* Add plugin framework. Now you can write your own plugins easily based on peda command
* Add multiple welcome logos (Your gdb need to support zlib)
* Enhance display. Make the length of the separation lines auto detect (Image is too large to display. Just find out
  yourself)
* Support both remote and local debug
* And so many features that I don't remember
